		<p >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A child who has once been pleased with a tale likes, as a rule, to have it retold in almost 
		the same words, but this should not lead parents to treat printed fairy stories as formal texts. 
It is always much better to tell a story than read it out of a book, and, if a parent can 
produce what, in the actual situation of the time and the child, is an improvement on the 
printed text, so much the better.</p> 
		<p >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A charge made against fairy tales is that they harm the child by frightening him or 
making him sad thinking. To prove the latter, one would have to show in a controlled 
experiment that children who have read fairy stories were more often sorry for cruelty than 
those who had not. As to fears, there are, I think, some cases of children being dangerously 
terrified by some fairy story. Often, however, this arises ( 出现 ) from the child having heard 
the story once. Familiarity with the story by repetition turns the pain of fear into the 
pleasure of a fear faced and mastered. </p>
		<p >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also people who object to fairy stories on the grounds that they are not 
objectively true, that giants, witches, twoheaded dragons, magic carpets, etc. do not exist; 
and that, instead of being fond of the strange side in fairy tales, the child should be taught to 
learn the reality by studying history. I find such people, I must say so peculiar ( 奇怪的 ) that 
I do not know how to argue with them. If their case were sound, the world should be full of 
mad men attempting to fly from New York to Philadelphia on a stick or covering a telephone 
with kisses in the belief that it was their beloved girlfriend.</p>  
		<p >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No fairy story ever declared to be a description of the real world and no clever child has 
ever believed that it was.</p>
